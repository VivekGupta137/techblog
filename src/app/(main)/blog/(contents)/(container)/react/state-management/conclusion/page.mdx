# Conclusion

## Result
Winner: Jotai

Jotai >= Zustand > Redux > Recoil > Context API


## Learning Curve
Winner: Context API

Context API > Zustand > Jotai > Recoil > Redux

Context API has the lowest learning curve because it's built into React. 
Zustand and Jotai are also easy to learn because they have a minimal API, if one has worked with Redux previously(like me) they will find Zustand more intuitive. 
Recoil and Redux have a steeper learning curve because they have more concepts to understand.


## Developer Experience
Winner: Jotai

Jotai > Zustand > Recoil > Redux > Context API

Jotai and Zustand have a great developer experience because they are lightweight and have a minimal API. 
Recoil is also good because it has built-in tools for asynchronous state management. 
Redux has a good developer experience, but it has more boilerplate code compared to the other libraries. 
Context API has the lowest developer experience because it requires more boilerplate code.

## Mantainability
Winner: Jotai

Jotai > Zustand > Redux > Context API > Recoil

Jotai and Zustand are easy to maintain because they have a minimal API. 
Redux is also good because it has a clear separation of concerns. 
Context API is harder to maintain because it requires more boilerplate code. 
Recoil library is not actively maintained making it harder to maintain.
