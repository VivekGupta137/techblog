# Conclusion

## Result
Winner: Zustand

Zustand >= Jotai > Redux > Recoil > Context API


## My learning curve exoerience
Winner: Context API

Context API > Zustand > Jotai > Recoil > Redux

Context API has the lowest learning curve because it's built into React. 
Zustand and Jotai are also easy to learn because they have a minimal API, if one has worked with Redux previously(like me) they will find Zustand more intuitive. 
Recoil and Redux have a steeper learning curve because they have more concepts to understand.


## My developer experience
Winner: Jotai

Jotai > Zustand > Recoil > Redux > Context API

Jotai and Zustand offer a great developer experience because they're lightweight, easy to use, and have clear documentation. 
Recoil is also good, as it requires less boilerplate code than Redux, though its documentation can be overwhelming, even for simple concepts. 
Redux, while popular with a large community, has more boilerplate compared to these libraries, but finding solutions is easier. 
The Context API offers the least developer-friendly experience due to the extra boilerplate it requires.

## Mantainability
Winner: Jotai

Jotai > Zustand > Redux > Context API > Recoil

Jotai and Zustand are easy to maintain because they have a minimal API. 
Redux is also good because it has a clear separation of concerns. 
Context API is harder to maintain because it requires more boilerplate code. 
Recoil library is not actively maintained making it hard to maintain for future.

## Jotai vs Zustand

Just a few thoughts on why I prefer Zustand over Jotai.

* If you need state to be accessible outside of React, zustand works better, it nativly keeps the state outside of react state. If you have a background job that needs to access this state I would recommend zustand.
* Jotai uses suspense for async state. While this allows for greater DX it can result in hard to debug issues. I had some weird hard to debug bugs with Fetch app that got caused by this. While it is fixable. Having 1 place in time where you hydrate all the states is easier to reason about.
* Jotai has a lower learning curve, nicer syntax, and feels like it just works.
