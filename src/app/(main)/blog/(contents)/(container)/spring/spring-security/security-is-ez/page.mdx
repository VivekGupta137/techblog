# Security with Spring is really easy!

[Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) helps developers to secure any application by providing us a nice framework for implementing robust security measures.

I'll try my best to explain how Spring Security works and how you can use it to secure your application.

#### Security is hard AF!
Creating a secure application is hard. If you are not careful, you can easily introduce security vulnerabilities into your application. 
Spring Security helps you to avoid these pitfalls by providing a framework for implementing security measures in your application.

Security is something that any application serving content over the internet should take very seriously. 
For example - if you are building a web application, you should be aware of the following security measures:
* Authentication - verifying the identity of a user.
* Authorization - determining what a user can and cannot do.
* Data protection - ensuring that data is secure and cannot be tampered with.
* Session management - managing user sessions securely.
* Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection - preventing CSRF attacks.
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection - preventing XSS attacks.
* Clickjacking protection - preventing clickjacking attacks.
* Security headers - setting security headers to protect against common security vulnerabilities.

TBH - I have never implemented security from scratch. I always use Spring Security to secure my applications. It's easy to use and provides a lot of features out of the box.


## Simplified Security Flow
<FFLOW />

## Core Concept
Spring Security acts as a gatekeeper between the client and the business logic.

### Client Request
When a client makes an `HTTP request` to our Tomcat web server running a Spring Boot application, the `HTTP request` is converted to a Java object called `HttpServletRequest` by the web server and sent to the Spring application.

### Security Filters
Before the `HTTP request` reaches our controller, it is first intercepted by `Security Filters` to perform authentication and authorization logic. The first task of security filters is to convert the credentials received from the `HttpServletRequest` into an `Authentication` object. This object contains fields such as username, password, and isAuthenticated (initially set to false). The username and password are extracted from the `HttpServletRequest`. Once the `Authentication` object is created, it is used throughout the authentication flow.

There are various security filters, each responsible for a specific aspect of security. For example, one filter checks whether the user is authenticated, another redirects unauthenticated users to the login page, and another handles authorization logic.

### Authentication Manager
After the `Authentication` object is created, the security filters send it to the `Authentication Manager`, which is responsible for completing the authentication process and returning the response (success or failure) back to the filters.

### Authentication Providers
The `Authentication Manager` itself does not contain the logic to authenticate but delegates this task to `Authentication Providers`, which contain the actual authentication logic.

There can be multiple authentication providers, and the authentication manager will check with each provider to determine whether the authentication is successful or failed using a simple loop.

`Authentication Providers` use a User Details Service to load the `userDetails` (username, password, user roles) for the given username from the database.

Finally, the `Authentication Provider` uses a `Password Encoder` to compare the password in the `userDetails` object with the password in the `Authentication` object.

If the comparison is successful, the `isAuthenticated` field of the `Authentication` object is set to true by the `Authentication Provider`, and this object is returned to the `Authentication Manager`, which then returns the same object back to the `Security Filters`.

Once the `Security Filters` receive the `Authentication` object from the `Authentication Manager`, they save the authentication details in the `Security Context Holder`. Finally, the request is sent to the `Dispatcher Servlet`, which maps the request to our controllers.

### Security Context Holder
After successful authentication, the `Authentication` object is set in the `Security Context Holder`. By default, it stores the `Authentication` object in the form of a HashMap. The key for the stored `Authentication` object is stored as a cookie in the client's browser, which is then used for subsequent requests without needing to pass the username/password credentials with every request. By default, this cookie is stored as `JSESSIONID` in the browser. Whenever a new request comes in, Spring Security checks if that cookie is present. If not, the request is rejected.

## Security Filters

Some important filters in Spring Security are:
### BasicAuthenticationFilter
- This filter is responsible for authenticating the user using the username and password when using basic authentication.
- This filter is responsible for initializing the `Authentication` object.
- Once the `Authentication` object is created, it is passed to the `Authentication Manager`.
- If the authentication is successful, the `Authentication` object is stored in the `Security Context Holder`.
- If the authentication is unsuccessful, a BadCredentialsException exception is thrown.

### AuthorizationFilter
- This filter is responsible to identify whether the user is trying to access a protected route.
- This checks for all the authorities and roles that the user has and based on that, it decides whether the user is authorized to access the route or not.
