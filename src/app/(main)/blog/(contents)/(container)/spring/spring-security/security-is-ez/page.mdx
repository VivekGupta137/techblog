# Security with Spring is really easy!

[Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) helps developers to secure any application by providing us a nice framework for implementing robust security measures.

I'll try my best to explain how Spring Security works and how you can use it to secure your application.

#### Security is hard AF!
Creating a secure application is hard. If you are not careful, you can easily introduce security vulnerabilities into your application. 
Spring Security helps you to avoid these pitfalls by providing a framework for implementing security measures in your application.

Security is something that any application serving content over the internet should take very seriously. 
For example - if you are building a web application, you should be aware of the following security measures:
* Authentication - verifying the identity of a user.
* Authorization - determining what a user can and cannot do.
* Data protection - ensuring that data is secure and cannot be tampered with.
* Session management - managing user sessions securely.
* Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection - preventing CSRF attacks.
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection - preventing XSS attacks.
* Clickjacking protection - preventing clickjacking attacks.
* Security headers - setting security headers to protect against common security vulnerabilities.

TBH - I have never implemented security from scratch. I always use Spring Security to secure my applications. It's easy to use and provides a lot of features out of the box.
