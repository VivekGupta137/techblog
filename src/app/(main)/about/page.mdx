## About me
Hey! I&apos;m a full-stack web developer with a passion for modern web technologies like React, Next.js, and GraphQL. I love building scalable, user-friendly applications, and I&apos;ve worked on everything from small websites to complex projects using tools like urql, Docker, and Spring Boot. I also hold a Master&apos;s degree from IIIT Bangalore, where I sharpened my skills in computer science and development.

When I&apos;m not coding or learning the latest in tech, I enjoy playing CS2, playing badminton, and binge-watching the latest shows on Netflix. I believe in staying curious, whether it&apos;s figuring out the next big framework or learning new skills through YouTube tutorials.

I&apos;m always open to job opportunities, collaborations, and connecting with people who share my passion for tech and web development. If you&apos;re interested in building something cool together or just want to chat, feel free to connect with me on <Link href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-gupta137/' alt="Vivek's linkedIn page" target="_blank" className="hover:underline">LinkedIn</Link>.
