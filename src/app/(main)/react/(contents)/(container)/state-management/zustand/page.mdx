# Zustand
Simpler and easier to get started with. It's more lightweight and intuitive for smaller applications or when you just need state without a lot of boilerplate.

## Demo
Following is a simple counter app using zustand.
<ZustandExample />

## Core concept
Zustand is a small, fast and scaleable bearbones state-management solution using a simple hook based API that creates a global store for your project.
It's great for simple and moderate state management. It can manage complex state but doesn't provide the same structured approach as Redux.

## Installation
First you will need to install the following library:

```sh
bun add zustand
```

## Usage
Create a file `ZustandExample.tsx` and add the following code:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="ZustandExample.tsx"
import { create } from "zustand";
import Counter from "../Counter";

const useCountStore = create<State & Actions>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
}));

const ZustandExample = () => {
  const count = useCountStore((state) => state.count);
  const increment = useCountStore((state) => state.increment);
  const decrement = useCountStore((state) => state.decrement);

  return <Counter count={count} increment={increment} decrement={decrement} />;
};

```
