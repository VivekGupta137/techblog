# Recoil
Recoil uniquely offers fine-grained reactivity, allowing components to subscribe only to the specific pieces of state they use, and supports asynchronous state management with built-in tools like selectors for derived or async state, unlike many other libraries.

## Demo \#1 (Counter App)
Following is a simple counter app using recoil.
<RecoilMain />

## Core concept
Its core concept revolves around atoms and selectors.
* **Atoms**: Atoms represent the state of our application. They are the smallest unit of state in Recoil.
* **Selectors**: Selectors are derived state. They are used to calculate the state based on the atoms.

## Installation
First you will need to install the following library:

```sh
bun add recoil
```

## Usage
Create a file `RecoilMain.tsx` and add the following code:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="RecoilMain.tsx"
import { RecoilRoot, atom } from "recoil";
import RecoilCounter from "./RecoilCounter";

type countStateType = number;

export const countState = atom<countStateType>({
  key: "countState",
  default: 0,
});

const RecoilMain = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <RecoilRoot>
        <RecoilCounter />
      </RecoilRoot>
    </div>
  );
};

export default RecoilMain;
```

Create a file `RecoilCounter.tsx` and add the following code:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="RecoilCounter.tsx"
import { useRecoilState } from "recoil";
import { countState } from "./RecoilMain";
import Counter from "../Counter";

const RecoilCounter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useRecoilState(countState);
    const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
    const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
    return ( <Counter count={count} increment={increment} decrement={decrement} /> );
}
 
export default RecoilCounter;
```

## Demo \#2 (Fetching user data)
Following is a simple example of fetching user data using recoil.

**API :** [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1)

```tsx showLineNumbers title="RecoilFetch.tsx"
const RecoilFetch = () => {
  return <div>Fetch using recoil</div>;
};

export default RecoilFetch;
```
